page structure
We have four wildly different sites, but they all use the same structural elements, or zones: headers, navigation areas, sections, and articles.
For example, if you look at the New York Times, they use the nav for browsing sections, searching for an article, or accessing membership options and account settings. On Airbnb, the nav allows you become a host or access your account settings. The navigation bars are suited to each site's content but are not fundamentally different.
Additionally, websites often rearrange their content blocks when viewed on mobile devices and tablets. You'll often notice articles or smaller content pieces stacking vertically on smaller screen sizes.
Structural elements in HTML include:
•	header tag: the section at the top of a web page that often includes a logo and sometimes a nav
•nav tag: a set of menu items that allow a user to navigate to different pages on a site
•section tag: a general section of related content
•	article tag: a piece of content that can be independently shared, like a blog post or newspaper article (even if you don't display the full article text, like you just show a preview, you can still use an article tag to delineate this content)
•	footer tag: the section at the bottom of a page that often has additional links and perhaps social sharing icons
•	aside tag: content that is complementary but not crucial to the page's main content (this could be an informative side section on a related subject)
•	figure tag: a grouped image and caption that create an informative visual of some kind
Let's look at a very generic desktop page structure first:
